*Missing Man Ministry’s annual fall banquet is coming up, and you’re invited.*

As many of you know, I’m on the board of advisors for Missing Man Ministry, a group dedicated to helping widows and fatherless children in need. It’s rough enduring the loss of a loved one, and as time goes on, bills still need to be paid, homes still need to be maintained, etc. That’s where we come in, and on October 6, I invite you to join us as we host our 7th Annual Fall Dinner Banquet & Auction. We’ll auction off some amazing prizes, and since our staff is 100% volunteer-based, all of the proceeds go toward our mission. Check out the prizes below\!

If you’d like to know more about this upcoming event or you’re interested in attending, [visit our website](http://www.missingmanministry.org/missing-man-dinner-banquet/){: target="_blank"}. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I hope to see you there\!
