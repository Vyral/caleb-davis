As you know, our annual Tomato Plant Giveaway is an important event for the Fohl & Hernandez Real Estate team. Every year, going all the way back to 1981, we deliver thousands of plants to our friends and clients as a token of our appreciation. This year, we thought the coronavirus would put an end to our beloved tradition, but it didn’t. We found a way to arrange safe delivery for every plant we ordered.&nbsp;

**To see the full story of how we did it, watch the video above.** As you’ll see, we were able to set up our very own tomato plant drive-through in our office parking lot, and the reaction was priceless. If you ever have any real estate needs, or there’s anything we can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re here to help.&nbsp;
