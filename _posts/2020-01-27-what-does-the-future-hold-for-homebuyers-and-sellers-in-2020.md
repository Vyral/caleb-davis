<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you plan on buying or selling a home at any point soon, I’ve got some valuable information to share with you today.</em></p>

You may have heard news of doom and gloom regarding our real estate market, but at the end of the day, nobody has a crystal ball. **Here are some facts and figures that show where we’ve been and where we are right now.**

In 2009, there were over 1,442 homes sold in Hayward. In 2019, only 258 homes were sold. **We definitely have a housing shortage right now.**

As far as home sale prices go, Hayward, Castro Valley, Fremont, and Union City all hit their peaks in 2018. In 2019, San Leandro and San Lorenzo both followed suit. **With inventory so low, we’re expecting our appreciation to drop to about 3% in 2020.**

If your goals for 2020 include buying or selling a home, this is the time of year when people start to put their plans into action.

**If you’re a seller, now is the time to go room by room and make the home look as beautiful as possible.** Declutter and deep clean so the place looks nice and spacious.

**If you’re a buyer, reach out to a real estate professional or a lender to figure out what your budget should be** and what the right mortgage fit is for you.&nbsp;

Finally, if you like spreadsheets and seeing the data right in front of you, let me know. I can send you a confidential report that covers the core cities in the East Bay every month. Just reach out via phone or email and I’ll send them over. I’d also be happy to answer any questions you may have.
