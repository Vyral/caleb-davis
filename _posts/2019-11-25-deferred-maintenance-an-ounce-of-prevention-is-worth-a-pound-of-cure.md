What is deferred maintenance and how does it apply to a home sale?

**Deferred maintenance is the work you’ve chosen to defer or address in your home at a future date.** Often when I’m hired to sell a property, there are upgrades that need to be made to sell the home for the highest price possible, such as repainting the interior, replacing the roof, etc.&nbsp;

So, here’s a good rule of thumb if you plan on selling your home: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. These upgrades will greatly affect your home’s value. At times, they can seem daunting, but if you put yourself on a maintenance schedule and tackle them a little bit at a time, you’ll significantly reduce their size and scope.&nbsp;

If you’d like to see an example of a maintenance schedule, I’d be happy to show you the same one I use for my home so you don’t put off for tomorrow what should be done today. Just give me a call or send me an email.&nbsp;

In summary, **if you choose to defer maintenance at your home sale, you’ll pay four times as much as you would if you just did the work now.&nbsp;**
