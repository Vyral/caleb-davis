What do you and I both have in common with Oprah Winfrey and Darren Hardy?&nbsp;

**We each have 24 hours in a day.** The only difference is how they spend their 24 hours and we spend ours.&nbsp;

I know what you may be thinking right now: This isn’t real estate related. Well, actually it is—allow me to explain.&nbsp;

Whether you’re selling a home or upgrading for your first home purchase, you can typically afford a larger home the further you’re willing to drive from urban areas. Before you do so, there are a few things to consider.

If you commute two hours a day, that adds up to 10 hours a week, 40 hours a month, and 360 hours a year. In total, that’s 15 days’ worth of driving—15 days that each have 24 hours in them. I don’t know about you, but most of my clients want what I want: more time with the people we love and work hard for.&nbsp;

**So before you buy or sell, calculate your new proposed drive time** and decide if having twice the home for half the price is worth the precious moments with your friends, family, and loved ones that you’ll never get back.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
