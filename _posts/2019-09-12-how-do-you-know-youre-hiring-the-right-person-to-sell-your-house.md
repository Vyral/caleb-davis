A lot of agents out there claim to be the best in the area, but, of course, this isn’t true. To truly identify whether you’re hiring the right person to help you sell your home, there are a few key steps you should take.

**First, visit your local title company and ask for a list of agents and the homes they’ve sold in your neighborhood.** After you’ve narrowed down your search to a few local top producers, check for open houses those agents are hosting in your area. But don’t reveal that you’re thinking of selling just yet. Instead, simply attend the open house, see what kind of questions the agent asks, and get a feel for how they operate.

If the listing agent seems friendly, knowledgeable, and otherwise engaged, I recommend doubling down on your research efforts by checking out their online presence after you leave the open house. Looking at their social media platforms, their online reviews, and, if available, testimonies from past clients, should give you a clear picture of what kind of service they provide.

**After you’ve taken all of these steps, choose a handful of agents who seem the most qualified and then reach out to them for an interview.** This will allow you to speak with them one-on-one about your goals, their qualifications, and what they’re prepared to offer you as a professional. &nbsp;

This final step should help guide you toward the right decision for your real estate needs.&nbsp;
