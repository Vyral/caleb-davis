*Today I’ll share my four tips for preparing your home for selling in autumn.*

What do I need to do to prepare my home to sell in the autumn? Here are my top four tips:

**1\. Analyze the market.** Make sure you price your home correctly. You may know how to do this, but if you reach out to a qualified real estate agent they can help you as well. There are several things you should consider about the market, but a major one is to understand the type of market your area is in. Is it a seller’s, buyer’s, or balanced market?

**2\. Perform inspections and cleanings of HVAC systems.** It’s recommended by the heating and cooling professionals that your HVAC system be inspected and cleaned yearly. Similarly, since your fireplace is seldom used in the summer months but frequently in the winter, autumn is the best time to clean and inspect it.

**3\. Decorate and embrace the season.** If you choose to sell your home in autumn, there are several decorating and staging tips for that season. Popular holidays coming up are Halloween and Thanksgiving. Don’t hesitate to decorate for those holidays, as you can help a possible buyer envision themselves living in the home during these times.Don’t go overboard, though—it’s not a good idea to decorate your house with gory decor and props.

**4\. Turn on all the lights.** Showings in autumn are likely to happen when it’s dark, or getting dark outside. Having all your lights on will make your home seem larger. Your home could feel cramped, dim, and uninviting if it’s dark during the showing.

If you have any questions or need anything real estate related, reach out to me by phone or email, I’d love to help you.
