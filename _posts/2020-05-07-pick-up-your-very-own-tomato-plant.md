As you may already know, Fohl & Hernandez delivers over 20,000 tomato plants to the doorsteps here in the East Bay area every year. This year, due to COVID-19, we’ll be doing things a tad differently—we’d like to invite you to grow with us. **Stop by our office on Saturday, May 16, or Sunday, May 17, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. for a no-touch tomato plant pickup.** You’ll drive around the parking lot, pop your trunk, and we’ll load a brown paper bag inside so as to not create a mess for you. If you’d like to reserve yourself a plant ahead of time, follow this link.
