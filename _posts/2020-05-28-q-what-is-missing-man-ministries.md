Today Dave Doyle from Missing Man Ministries (or M3) joins me to discuss who they are and what they do. Missing Man Ministries is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to help widows and orphans. It began about nine years ago and grew out of a men’s bible study group, though they’re not associated with a specific church. It began by helping a local woman who had just lost her husband and didn’t know what to do. After helping her, the group decided they wanted to support more women and children. To learn more about M3 and how they’re trying to grow, watch my latest video above.
