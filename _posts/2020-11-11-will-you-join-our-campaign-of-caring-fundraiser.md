<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help us give back this year by participating in our Campaign for Caring.</em></p>

My wife Rachel and I have loved partnering with Missing Man Ministry, **a 100% volunteer-based program that benefits widows who have lost their husbands and children who have lost their fathers.&nbsp;**

One of the things that really makes this nonprofit stand out for me personally is the amount of courage that these widows consistently demonstrate in such a horrible time in their lives. It’s very moving for me personally and very near and dear to my heart.

I’m happy to announce that we have a growing community of donors and volunteers who are dedicated to the mission as well. **If you have donated already or volunteered, I just want to say thank you so much.**

Some ways that we’re able to help these widows is with financial gifts, chores around the property, and the deferred maintenance items that you always plan to get to, and it makes it even harder to get to when tragedy strikes. We’re just trying to ease the physical and financial burdens for these people.

I have a quick story I want to share with you. We came across two widows with four children who were raising them together while also doing distance learning off of one shared tablet and one shared smartphone. Because of donors like yourself, we were able to go out and get tablets for each of these children and their mothers. It felt like Christmas, and it made us so happy to be able to do that.

Due to COVID-19, we’re putting off our annual in-person banquet that is the biggest fundraising event of the year for us. I would like to invite you, along with Rachel and I, to help support Missing Man Ministry. You can donate here, where 100% of funds go to helping support widows and their children. You can also share the video above with your friends on social media. **We want to get the word out to as many people as possible.**

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
