If you’re thinking of buying a home, there are three main factors to consider before deciding whether you should buy now or wait.&nbsp;

The first is your **financial situation**. Ask yourself: Are you in a position to make this move? Whether you’ve never bought a home before or you’re an experienced homebuyer, the best way to start the process is by talking to a trusted advisor or real estate agent.&nbsp;

The benefit of speaking with a real estate agent is they’re a licensed fiduciary, meaning they have to do what’s in your best interest—not theirs. If they know the market and have been in the business for a while, they’ll guide you accordingly.

The second factor is your **timeline horizon**. Are you looking to move within the next month, six months, or 12 months? If it’s within the next month, go talk to a real estate professional as soon as you can. If your timeline horizon is six to 12 months, you have more time to determine whether your finances are in order.&nbsp;

The last factor is the one thing you don’t have control over: **interest rates**. Rates are significantly low right now, so it might not be a bad idea to consider buying soon.&nbsp;
