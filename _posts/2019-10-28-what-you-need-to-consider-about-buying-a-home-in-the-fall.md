For those thinking about buying a house in the fall season, what should you be considering? Today I’ll cover three key points to keep in mind.

**1\. There is less competition.** Many consider the fall to be the off-season in real estate, but there are still homes for sale, and in some areas, there’s just as much inventory as the spring and summer. Fewer buyers tend to purchase in the fall, so that means you’ll have fewer offers to compete with. This also puts you in a great position to negotiate with sellers; some people need to have their home sold before the spring market.

**2\. You’ll be the center of attention.** Because spring and summer are usually busier than the fall, choosing to buy in those seasons could mean you’ll get less attention than you deserve from real estate professionals who have several things going on at once.

**3\. You can take advantage of year-end sales to outfit your home.** There are bound to be improvements you’ll want to make after buying the property, and you’ll also probably need certain items for your new home’s general upkeep. If you want to coordinate your purchase with sales on those items, then according to the Consumer Report, the calendar determines when it’s a good time to buy home goods. In particular, September is a great time to buy carpet and paint; October is a good time for lawnmowers; and in November, appliances and cookware are cheaper.

If you have a great real estate professional to reach out to, do it. It’ll be worth your time. After all, luck is when proper preparation meets opportunity.
